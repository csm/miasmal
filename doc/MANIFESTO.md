# The Miasma Manifesto

Social networks are a blight on society. The spread of
disinformation, the gamifcation of likes and follower counts,
turning the information and habits of the people using a
service into a product to be bought by the highest bidder,
all of this has lessened discourse between people and fallen
short of the great promise of the Internet. The aim of
companies running social networks is to maximize profits,
and to do this they must maximize their audience and
maximize the advertising dollars squeezed from them. The
end goals of these companies is opposite the needs and
wants of their user bases, and instead of optimizing the
experience for people, they optimize ways to addict,
distract, and trick people.

We want this to stop, we want an alternative. We want the
Internet we had in our youth, which had so much more
promise that where we are now.

Sharing things about ourselves, our photos, thoughts, and
media we like, or talking over topics in science, art,
technology et al., are wonderful things, and they are good
uses of the Internet. To that end, we propose a new website,
where people can share thoughts, photos, and videos, 

We are not free speech absolutists. Disinformation, hate
speech, racism, or anything else we deem as harmful is not
tolerated and not allowed on the site. We know policing
content is a difficult task to take on, and we recognize
that we will make mistakes, but we will constantly work to
do our best to maintain 

There will be no advertisements. The website will be free
to read (anonymously, if the author of a post allows it),
but writing requires a membership. We state up front that
the agreement here is that the community must support the
costs of running the site from the outset; if you don't
want to pay, that's fine, you don't have to use the site,
but we won't offer a service that we can't sustain. We are
fine if it eventually folds because it can't be sustained;
we still want something better, and we are going to try to
build that so if all we have in the end is our earnest
attempt, then that's enough.

All software running the site will be free software. All
software we write for this site will be licensed strictly
under the GNU General Public License, version 3.

The entity running this will (eventually) be a non-profit,
and we will make all income and expenses public information.

We are calling our new site the Miasma. We see the current
Internet as a miasma, as in the definition:

> an oppressive or unpleasant atmosphere which surrounds or emanates from something

So we are adopting this name in defiance of what social
networks have become, in the hopes of building something
better.
